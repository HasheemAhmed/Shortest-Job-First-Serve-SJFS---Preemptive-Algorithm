# Shortest-Job-First-Serve-SJFS---Preemptive-Algorithm
Shortest Job First Serve (SJFS) - Preemptive Algorithm Implementation in C++

Description:
This project implements the Shortest Job First Serve (SJFS) scheduling algorithm in C++. SJFS is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest burst time is executed first among the available processes.

Features:
User input for the number of processes, arrival time, and burst time.
Preemptive SJFS algorithm implementation.
Calculation of completion time (CT), waiting time (WT), and turnaround time (TAT).
Sorting of processes based on arrival time.
Display of a table summarizing process details and metrics.
Calculation of average waiting time.

File Structure:
sjfs.cpp: Contains the main C++ code implementing the SJFS algorithm.
README.md: Instructions and information about the project.

Instructions for Use:
Compile and run sjfs.cpp.
Enter the number of processes and input arrival time and burst time for each process when prompted.
The program will calculate and display CT, WT, TAT, and average waiting time.
Press any key to exit.

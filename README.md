# 🕒 Shortest Job First Serve (SJFS) - Preemptive Algorithm

## Description 📜

This project implements the Shortest Job First Serve (SJFS) scheduling algorithm in C++. SJFS is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest burst time is executed first among the available processes.

## Features 🌟

- 🖊️ **User Input**: For the number of processes, arrival time, and burst time.
- ⏳ **Preemptive SJFS Algorithm**: Implements the SJFS algorithm with preemptive capabilities.
- 📊 **Metrics Calculation**: Calculates completion time (CT), waiting time (WT), and turnaround time (TAT).
- 🗂️ **Sorting of Processes**: Based on arrival time.
- 📝 **Display Table**: Summarizes process details and metrics.
- 🧮 **Average Waiting Time**: Calculation of average waiting time for the processes.

## File Structure 📁

- `sjfs.cpp`: Contains the main C++ code implementing the SJFS algorithm.
- `README.md`: Instructions and information about the project.

## Instructions for Use 🚀

1. ⚙️ **Compile and Run** `sjfs.cpp`:
2. ▶️ **Enter Process Details**: Input the number of processes, arrival time, and burst time for each process when prompted.
3. 👀 **View Results**: The program will calculate and display CT, WT, TAT, and average waiting time.
4. ⌨️ **Press Any Key** to exit.
